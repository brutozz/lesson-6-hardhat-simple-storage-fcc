# Lesson # 5 > hardhat-simple-storage-fcc

This code was written as part of my introduction to full-blockchain-solidity-course-js from @PatrickAlphaC

This porject demostrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation that simply lists the available accounts. 

We've been relatively successful in creating our first project in hardhat.  
We got to know hardhat better, specifically:
- working with the hardhat.config.js configuration file
- working with smart contracts inside hardhat, compiling them, deploying them on local and global blockchain.
- We familiarized ourselves with tasks and scripts that help us in real deployment. 
- got to know and write the first tests for a smart contract.
- Familiarized ourselves with the tools for evaluating the quality of our tests (coverage and gas-reporter).
